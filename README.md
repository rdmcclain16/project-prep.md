# Project Prep

## Cooperation Plan
1. What are the key strengths of each person on the team? 
2. How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
3. In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
4. Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
